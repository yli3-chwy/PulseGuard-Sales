## EM Algorithm Overview


The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a statistical technique used for finding maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in probabilistic models, where the data involves latent (unobserved) variables. The EM algorithm is particularly useful in situations where there is incomplete or missing data. It iteratively alternates between two steps: the E-step (Expectation step) and the M-step (Maximization step).

1. Expectation Step (E-step):

    - In this step, the algorithm computes the expected values of the latent variables given the observed data and the current estimates of the parameters.
    - It calculates the posterior probability distribution of the latent variables.

2. Maximization Step (M-step):

    - In this step, the algorithm updates the parameters to maximize the expected log-likelihood obtained from the E-step.
    - The M-step involves finding the parameter values that maximize the expected log-likelihood, treating the expected values of the latent variables as if they were observed.

3. Iteration:

    - The E-step and M-step are repeated iteratively until convergence is reached. The algorithm aims to improve the parameter estimates with each iteration.

One common application of the EM algorithm is in Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), where it is used to estimate the parameters of a mixture of Gaussian distributions. In this context, each Gaussian component can be seen as a cluster in the data.

It's important to note that while the EM algorithm is powerful, it doesn't guarantee finding the global maximum of the likelihood function, and its results can be sensitive to the choice of initial parameter values. Therefore, multiple runs with different initializations are often performed to increase the chances of finding a good solution.

## EM for Time Series Based Anomaly Detection

The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm itself may not be the most direct choice for time series-based anomaly detection, as it is more commonly associated with clustering and mixture modeling. However, you can incorporate EM-based models, like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), into a broader framework for time series anomaly detection.

Here's a general approach for using GMMs (or similar models) in the context of time series anomaly detection:


1. Feature Engineering:

    Extract relevant features from your sales data that can be used to describe the patterns over time. This might include daily, weekly, or monthly sales trends, seasonality, and other relevant metrics.

2. Model Training:

    Apply the EM algorithm or another clustering algorithm (like K-means) to train a model on the extracted features. In the case of GMMs, this involves estimating the parameters such as means, covariances, and weights for each Gaussian component.

3. Likelihood Computation:

    Calculate the likelihood of observing the sales data given the trained model. This step involves applying the probability density function (PDF) of the GMM to the observed data points.

4. Anomaly Score Calculation:

    Compute an anomaly score for each data point based on the likelihood values. Points with low likelihoods may be considered anomalies.

5. Thresholding:

    Set a threshold on the anomaly scores to classify data points as normal or anomalous. Points below the threshold are considered anomalies.

6. Monitoring Over Time:

    For time series data, it's crucial to consider the temporal aspect. You can monitor how the anomaly scores change over time and set adaptive thresholds based on historical data.

7. Evaluation and Refinement:

    Evaluate the performance of your anomaly detection system using labeled data (if available) or other metrics. Refine the model and parameters as needed.

While GMMs and the EM algorithm provide a probabilistic framework for modeling data, other time series anomaly detection methods may also be suitable, such as autoregressive models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or dedicated time series anomaly detection algorithms.
